# Contributing guide

 1. Contributions must be from an exisiting and approved issue on github.
 2. If you see an issue that you would like to tackle, leave a comment on it and I will assign it to you if I see fit.
 3. If you have an idea for this project, create an issue with the label `feature request` and we can discuss it.
 4. Code should be written in a new branch from 'dev'. A PR should then be created back into dev. I will then review and (if you're lucky) squash and merge it.
 5. Code should be written in accordance with the ESLint rules that are in place (airbnb with a few modifications).
